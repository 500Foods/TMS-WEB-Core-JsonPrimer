# TMS-WEB-Core-JSON-Primer

This repository contains various code samples that first appeared in TMS Blog posts about using JSON within
[TMS WEB Core](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/tmswebcore.asp). The original posts can be found in [Part 1](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/blog.asp?post=928) and [Part 2](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/blog.asp?post=932) and were first posted on May 5th and 6th, 2022.

**/Combined** contains the code for Examples 2-31, where the JavaScript, Delphi and TMS WEB Core 
variations are combined in each example. **/Delphi**, **/JavaScript**, and **/TMS WEB Core** contain simplified versions of
Examples 2-24, where only the specific variation is included, for those interested in just the one variation.

using JSON within TMS WEB Core projects, or if you find issues with any of the examples posted, by all means please
post an Issue or a Discussion item.

## Key Dependencies
While a solid understanding of JSON would help here, the point of the repository is to help understand how to use JSON in a TMS WEB Core or other Delphi project, potentially at a very basic level. As a result, there is only one key dependency to be aware of.
- [TMS WEB Core](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/tmswebcore.asp) - This is a TMS WEB Core project, after all
