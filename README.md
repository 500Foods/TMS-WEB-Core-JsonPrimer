# TMS-WEB-Core-JSON-Primer

This repository contains various code samples that first appeared in TMS Blog posts about using JSON within
[TMS WEB Core](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/tmswebcore.asp). The original posts can be found in [Part 1](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/blog.asp?post=928) and [Part 2](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/blog.asp?post=932) and were first posted on May 5th and 6th, 2022.
